# Utopia


## Background

A Look at the Relationship between Environments, Economies, and Human Development of countries across the world.

## Goal

*Validate or nullify perceived relationship between Happiness, Human Development and Environment
*Do environmental variables affect social and economic features
*Build “Utopia”


## The Process & Code Highlights
As a start, we will look at two basic tennis movements: forehand and backhand. In order to acheieve this, we will create a convulutional neural network (CNN). 

### Data

* Environmental Variables
      * Country
      * Accessibility_to_cities: 
      *Elevation
      *Aspect: orientation of slope
      *Slope
      *Cropland cover
      Tree canopy cover
      Temp max of the warmest month
      Rain seasonality/ other train data
      Temp – diurnal range
      Isothermality

* World Happiness
      Country
      Happiness Score: Based on the question: "How would you rate your happiness on a scale of 0 to 10 where 10 is the happiest."
      Generosity: 
      Dystopia Residual:
      Trust (Government Corruption): 
      Family: 
      Health (Life Expectancy):

* Human Development Index (HDI)
      Country
      HDI score (0-1)
      GNI (Gross National Income)
      Population
      Internet users
      Life expectancy
      Dependency ratios
      Inequality datasets
      Deaths due to Tuberculosis (per 100,000 people)
      Deaths due to Tuberculosis (per 100,000 people) 
      Total fertility rate (birth per woman) 2000/2007
      % of population in cities
      Secondary education
      Number of physicians per 10,000 people
      Public health expenditure




###  Utopia

*How to build a happy colony 
*Build a model to “learn” with existing data
*Create colonies with specific features
*Predict Happiness score
*What comprises happiest colony?

### Utopia - How?

*Identify correlation between Happiness and other features
*Choose the features at extreme ends of correlation
*Clean up/fix nulls
*Build a model based on above features
*Create a colony
